# Bioinnovate Africa Workshop 2022
Bioinnovate Africa Covid19 Workshop
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Workshop on "Harnessing data science to estimate the risk factors for the impacts of COVID-19 on health, welfare and food system in East African countries" (February.20-23). The goal of this workhop is to provide an introduction to many commonly used tools for epidemiological modelling. This workshop targets public health professionals, communication officers, and modellers who are fairly new to programming and command line data analysis. While becoming an expert in these skills will take more time and practice than this 1 week workshop, we hope that you will gain confidence with some of the tools and an awareness of additional resources to continue your learning afterward. 

This workshop is made possible thanks to support from Bioinnovate Africa Grant No. B8401F to Dr. Henri Tonnang, head DMMG unit at icipe, Kenya.
